***ASP.NET Core***
It is our primary framework for web app development, utilizing .NET and C# for full-stack capabilities. It includes built-in authentication for secure account management.

***Blazor***
It complements ASP.NET Core by enabling front-end development in C#, promoting a unified programming experience and ensuring seamless integration within the .NET ecosystem.

***Entity Framework Core***
Our choice for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), allowing for streamlined database communication without SQL, integrated with .NET for enhanced development productivity.

***Microsoft SQL Server**
Chosen for its solid performance and compatibility with Entity Framework Core, ensuring reliable data management within the .NET framework.

***Coding Language***
The application is developed in C#, which aligns with .NET's supported languages for consistent coding practices.
